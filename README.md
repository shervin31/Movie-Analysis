# Movie Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of movies to uncover key insights related to budget, gross earnings, ratings, and company performance. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing correlations between features, we gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence the success of films in the entertainment industry. The project leverages popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Identification and handling of missing data, data types, and duplicates.
- **Outlier Detection**: Boxplots to identify and visualize outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Calculation and visualization of feature correlations using heatmaps.
- **Company Performance**: Analysis of top companies by gross revenue and performance trends over time.
- **Budget vs Gross Earnings**: Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between movie budget and earnings.
- **Categorical Data Encoding**: Conversion of categorical data into numerical values for statistical analysis.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
  
## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is a collection of movie details, including attributes like movie title, budget, earnings, score, release date, and production company. The goal is to understand how various features of a movie (budget, genre, etc.) correlate with its gross earnings and how companies perform financially.
